# Gulp Workflow

## My static website workflow

Using Gulp, I've tried to limit manual operations as much as possible in the building process of a static website.

Plugins:

- gulp-rifraf
- gulp-jade
- gulp-html-prettify
- gulp-replace
- gulp-htmlhint
- gulp-jshint
- gulp-sass
- gulp-autoprefixer
- gulp-bless
- gulp-cssbeautify
- gulp-minify-css
- gulp-concat
- gulp-uglify
- gulp-rename
- gulp-notify
